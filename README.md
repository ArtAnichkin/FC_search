# MACHINE SEARCH AND ANALYSIS OF ZOLEDRONIC ACID ANALOGUES WITH HIGH CYTOTOXICITY 

Bisphosphonate compounds are common concomitant medications used in the treatment of many types of cancer that metastasize to the bone. At the moment, one of the main compounds of this class is zoledronic acid, which preserves bone mineral density by suppressing the activity of osteoclasts

This work is devoted to a machine search for analogues of zoledronic acid with a similar effect on osteoclasts, as well as those with their own high activity against cancer cells.

Our repository contains notebooks and Python models that can predict the toxicity of compounds towards osteoclast FPPS protein and cancer cell lines PC3, MCF7, and also generate new compounds with high activity towards all 3 targets.

## How repository work

Datasets and trained models are available at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WtDQLZIx_Zwt6z04H2ji3JKgEYXwAWhX?usp=sharing)
<!---
For data preparation you should run notebooks from `/notebooks/preparing_datasets` folder. Path for input file load from corresponding folders in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WtDQLZIx_Zwt6z04H2ji3JKgEYXwAWhX?usp=sharing).

For models validation for organic compounds you should run notebooks from `/notebooks/validation` folder. Path for input file load from corresponding folders in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WtDQLZIx_Zwt6z04H2ji3JKgEYXwAWhX?usp=sharing).

To get trained models for organic compounds you should run notebooks from `/notebooks/optimization` folder or load trained models . Path for input file load from corresponding folders in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WtDQLZIx_Zwt6z04H2ji3JKgEYXwAWhX?usp=sharing). 

To get trained models for metal complexes you should run notebooks from `/src/optimization` folder or load trained models . Path for input file load from corresponding folders in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WtDQLZIx_Zwt6z04H2ji3JKgEYXwAWhX?usp=sharing).
